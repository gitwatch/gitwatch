#   Idea and original code taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/965274 
#       (but heavily modified by now)
#
#   Requires the command 'inotifywait' to be available, which is part of
#   the inotify-tools (See https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools ),
#   and (obviously) git.
#   Will check the availability of both commands using the `which` command
#   and will abort if either command (or `which`) is not found.
