# Set the default behavior for all files.
# - text=auto: Git will auto-detect if a file is text or binary.
# - eol=lf:    Force all text files to use Unix-style (LF) line endings
#              on checkout. This is CRITICAL for shell scripts.
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Shell Scripts (Must be LF) ---
# Explicitly enforce LF for all shell scripts, as CRLF will break them.
# Also, correctly identify .bats files as Shell for GitHub's linguist.

# --- Windows Scripts (Must be CRLF) ---
# Override the 'eol=lf' default and enforce CRLF for Windows-native
# scripts, as cmd.exe requires them.
